"I developed a News Portal using Python and Django REST Framework for the backend,frontend and utilized Docker for containerization. The project includes a RESTful API that manages news articles, categories, user authentication, and comments. It supports CRUD operations for managing news content and interacts with a PostgreSQL database. Docker was used to ensure the application can run in an isolated environment for easy deployment and scalability."
